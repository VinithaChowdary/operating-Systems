This project was done in the 3rd semester as a part of the operating systems project. "Custom CLI with Integrated File Encryption and Compression Utility," introduces a robust and multifaceted tool that merges a custom command-line interface (CLI) with file encryption and compression functionalities. Developed using Tkinter for the graphical user interface, this project aims to provide users with a simulated command-line environment where they can efficiently navigate directories, execute diverse file operations, and utilize custom commands. The CLI component enhances user experience by offering a wide array of file and directory operations, including creation, deletion, renaming, searching, and compression. One of the central features of this project is the file encryption and compression utility that supports the Fernet encryption method, allowing users to secure their files and optimize storage space through compression. This dual functionality caters to the security and space optimization needs of users, making it a versatile and essential tool for managing sensitive information.

The project's design emphasizes versatility, user-friendliness, and security. In addition to basic file operations, the CLI includes features such as sorting files based on size, name, modification date, and file type, providing users with effective options to organize and analyze their file system. The encryption feature ensures that sensitive files are protected using a dynamically generated key, offering an additional layer of security for confidential data. Moreover, the project incorporates functionalities like file compression using the zipfile library and setting file permissions using the "chmod" command, providing greater control over files and directories. The inclusion of a command history feature and a "Clear Screen" button further enhances the user experience, making this CLI a comprehensive and powerful solution for secure and efficient file management
